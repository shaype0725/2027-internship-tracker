# 2027 Internship Tracker

![demo](assets/demo.svg)

**Summer 2026 and Summer 2027 SWE, AI/ML, Quant, Hardware, and PM internship listings -- plus a built-in application tracker so you know where you applied, when, and how long ago.**

> Just here for the list? [Jump to listings](#listings)

Most internship repos stop at the list. Fork this one and you also get:

- A personal tracker that lives next to the listings
- A `days-since-applied` column so nothing goes quiet without you noticing
- Daily Top 20 picks ranked by freshness + company signal + YC batch
- Listings that refresh 5x per day automatically via GitHub Actions -- no setup needed

**[Fork to start tracking your applications →](https://github.com/SuryaHarikrishnan/2027-internship-tracker/fork)**

```bash
python scripts/track.py add "Stripe" "SWE Intern" "2026-08-11" "Applied"
python scripts/track.py update 0 "Interviewed"
python scripts/track.py render   # writes APPLICATIONS.md
```
